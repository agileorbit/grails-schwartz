[[quartzService]]
== QuartzService

The plugin includes a utility service, `quartzService`, that it uses internally for much of the interaction with the Quartz `Scheduler` and other tasks, and you can also use it in your application. Add a dependency injection for the service like for any Spring bean (`QuartzService quartzService` or `def quartzService`). The service's methods are described below.
